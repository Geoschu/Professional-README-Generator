# Professional-README-Generator

A command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

## Motivation

This project was built to streamline the process of creating professional README files for GitHub projects.

## Why This Was Built

Creating a well-structured README is a repetitive task. This project was built to automate that process and ensure consistency across projects.

## What It Solved

This application solves the problem of spending unnecessary time manually creating README files for every new project.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to use the Inquirer package to create a command-line application and how to dynamically generate markdown files using JavaScript.
